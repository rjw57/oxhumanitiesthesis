A Simple LyX Example Document for the Oxford University Thesis Class
====================================================================

Copy the ``ociamthesis-example.lyx`` to, for example ``thesis.lyx`` *in the
same directory as the original file*, open in LyX and start editing. The
``thesis.lyx`` file must be in the same directory as ``ociamthesis.layout``,
``crest.eps`` and ``crest-eps-converted-to.pdf`` because they are included by
the example file as a relative path. Advanced users can copy those to the
system LyX and LaTeX paths. Advanced users know where those are :).
